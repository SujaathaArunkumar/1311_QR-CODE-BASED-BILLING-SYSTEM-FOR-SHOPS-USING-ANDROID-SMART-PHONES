6. About (Short Description / Summary): Augmented reality is a technology that involves digital content deployed in the physical
 world in real time through the use of devices and sensors that allow users to interact with the resulting hybrid environment. 
Likewise, QR codes have become popular and accepted by the general public. They are useful for conveying information in the physical
 world and thus connect to the digital world in a practical and simple way. This project presents an application of QR codes for generating
 augmented reality environments. Using the notion of contexts, a complete user interaction is enabled in terms of the relationship of QR 
codes and augmented reality. We present an analysis of augmented reality technologies supported by this approach as well as the architecture 
and operation of a system that implements these concepts.
